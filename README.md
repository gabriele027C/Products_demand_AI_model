#Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-based system for product demand forecasting and inventory optimization.
The repository will document every step of the development process, from data exploration to model training and evaluation.

The system is based on real-world datasets from Kaggle, such as “Store Item Demand Forecasting”, and is designed to be scalable and extendable for more advanced predictive and optimization use cases.

Technologies & Libraries:

Python

scikit-learn

pandas

NumPy

matplotlib

seaborn

Objectives:

Analyze historical sales data

Predict future product demand

Optimize stock management decisions

Create a solid foundation for future AI-driven business intelligence tools
